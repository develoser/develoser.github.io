<h3>Working Experience</h3>
<h4>Fullstack Developer <strong>@</strong> <a href="http://dealerx.com/">DealerX</a></h4>

<p>At DealerX I fulfilled one of my career dreams: <strong>Remote Work</strong> on an US based company. Besides that, they ask me to bring my experience on what I really love to do: JavaScript FTW! plus gave me the lead of experimental QA processes for an Edge-Analytics-Tool powered by several Amazon Services.</p>

<p>It's being an amazing experience, a mindset change, since moved to the dragon's cave ðŸ˜œ (Backend).</p>

<p>Discovered from first hand the benefits of the cloud, working with cutting-edge technologies like Google Cloud (storage: managing in seconds files of GBs, Big Query: processing GBs of data in secs) and AWS (Lambda Functions: microservices!, S3).</p>

<p>Every single piece of code (nodejs module) has its own set of unit and integration testing, which allowed us to easily "taste" different approaches of architecture. Since the modules were no tied to any specific environment, we sometimes switched the code from be running over restify server to later as microservices using AWS Lambda + AWS API Gateway or even over AWS Beanstalk with minimum of configuration.</p>

<p>One of my latest aventures was mapping millions of unique IPs (v4) to their geolocation point, using Big Query + UDF (user defined functions written in JS and running over big query database) and seeing the output in less than a minute. Cloud, you're awesome!.</p>
