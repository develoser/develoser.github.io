			"summary": "At Softtek I returned to my real passion: the web development. Due to the size and scope of the project (300,000+ users), in our development workflow we follow a SCRUM methodology in order to keep all the stakeholders aligned and in compliance with the project goals, so I have to talk directly with the client on daily basis. Based on my knowledge and experience in the fall of 2013 I became on offshore team leader, providing mentoring and coaching for my colleagues and technical references in the project. So the most of time you can find me coding, troubleshooting, coordinating people, helping up clients, following up issues, looking into git, etc. Just let’s say there is always something to do.",

				"Unit Testing: Reduced the amount of bugs found at Stage or even Production environment using a TDD methodology (Karma, Jasmine, Sinon, PhantomJS)",
				"ANT to GruntJS migration: Legacy build process took 25-30min to be completed. I led a migration process from ANT to GrunJS (a JS-written tasks automation tool) which reduced the process to just 30-45 secs."
