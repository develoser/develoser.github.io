<h4>Fullstack Developer <strong>@</strong> <a href="http://dealerx.com/">DealerX</a></h4>
<h5>Remote / Home Office | Jul 2015 - Present</h5>

<p>At DealerX I fulfilled one of my career dreams: <strong>Remote Work</strong> on an US based company. Besides that, they ask me to bring my experience on what I really love to do: JavaScript FTW! plus gave me the lead of experimental QA processes for an Edge-Analytics-Tool powered by several Amazon Services.</p>

<p>I was quickly moved to the BackEnd team and it's being an amazing experience, a mindset change, moved to the dragon's cave üêâ</p>

<p>Discovered from first hand the benefits of the cloud, working with cutting-edge technologies like Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>Every single piece of code has its own set of unit and integration testing, which allowed us to easily "taste" different approaches of architecture. Since the modules were no tied to any specific environment, we sometimes switched the code from be running over restify server to later as microservices using AWS Lambda + AWS API Gateway or lately as AWS Batch Job.</p>

<p>Led by the better architecture for current issues, I have implemented solutions using different languages like pure JavaScript with ES5, ES6, TypeScript, JSX and Python, being this one the perfect complement in my latest adventure: <i>Dynamic Advertising</i>.</p>

<p>Right now I'm in charge (among other things) of the creation of Dynamic Advertisement for Automotive Inventories using Google AdWords and Facebook Business/Marketing API, everything handled by AWS and Magic. üßô

<h4>Sr. Frontend Developer and Tech Lead <strong>@</strong> <a href="http://softtek.com/">Softtek</a></h4>
<h5>Aguascalientes, M√©xico | Nov 2011 - Feb 2015</h5>

<p>At Softtek I returned to my real passion: the web development.</p>
<p>Due to the size and scope of the project (300,000+ users), in our development workflow we follow a SCRUM methodology in order to keep all the stakeholders aligned and in compliance with the project goals, so I have to talk directly with the client on daily basis. </p>
<p>Based on my knowledge and experience in the fall of 2013 I became on offshore team leader, providing mentoring and coaching for my colleagues and technical references in the project. So the most of time you can find me coding, troubleshooting, coordinating people, helping up clients, following up issues, looking into git, etc. Just let‚Äôs say there is always something to do.</p>
<p>Some initiatives and process improvement I have led at Softtek:</p>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Puppeteer:</strong> A dashboard-like web application that allow QA Team and Clients to turn on/off code features for our main application on demand. (BackboneJS, Handlebars, CSS3, Bootstrap, SASS, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB) </li>
    <li> <strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Reduced the amount of bugs found at Stage or even Production environment using a TDD methodology (Karma, Jasmine, Sinon, PhantomJS) </li>
    <li> <strong>ANT to GruntJS migration:</strong> Legacy build process took 25-30min to be completed. I led a migration process from ANT to GrunJS (a JS-written tasks automation tool) which reduced the process to just 30-45 secs. </li>
</ul>
